# FFT-and-its-application-noise-reduction-and-voice-recognition
We apply Fourier analysis to audio to extract spectral data by transforming the signal from time domain into chosen sinusoids in frequency domain that allow us to extract more useful data that can be used in noise reduction as an application.
